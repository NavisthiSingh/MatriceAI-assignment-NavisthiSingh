Matrice AI Assignment
This project involves implementing an object detection pipeline using the YOLOv11x model. The dataset was prepared using Roboflow, split into training, validation, and test sets, and converted into YOLOv8 format for training. Data augmentations were applied to improve model generalization. Finally, the model was integrated into the Matrice platform following BYOM (Bring Your Own Model) guidelines.

Project Workflow
1. Dataset Preparation
•	Source: I downloaded a dataset from Kaggle containing diverse object categories.
•	Category Selection: Chose 5 categories with 100 images each to keep the dataset manageable.
•	Splitting: I used Roboflow to split images
o	Training Set: 70%
o	Validation Set: 20%
o	Test Set: 10%
•	Conversion: I Used Roboflow to format the dataset to YOLOv8 specifications for seamless integration with the YOLOv11x model training pipeline.

2. Data Augmentation
I downloaded Rice Image Dataset from Kaggle 
o	Horizontal flipping
o	Random scaling
o	Rotation (up to ±15 degrees)
o	Color jittering (brightness, contrast adjustments)

3. Model Selection
•	Using the provided hash function:
python
Copy code
import hashlib
name = "Navisthi Singh"
x = int(hashlib.sha256(name.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest(), 16) % 50
print(x)  # Output: 17
•	The model ranked 17th on Papers with Code for real-time object detection on the COCO dataset was selected: YOLOv11x.

.
4.Model Training
•	Implementation:
o	Designed a train.py script for training the YOLOv11x model.
o	Integrated data loading for the YOLOv8 dataset format.
o	Included dynamic data augmentation during the training phase.
•	Baseline Training:
o	Conducted training without augmentations to establish a performance benchmark.
•	Augmented Training:
o	Incorporated augmentations from dataset_utils.py during training.
•	Evaluation:
o	Assessed model performance using COCO evaluation metrics 
o	Compared results of baseline and augmented training, observing improvements in small-object and overlapping-object detection.
•	Test Visualization:
o	Visualized the model’s predictions on test images using a custom function to plot bounding boxes and labels.

5. Matrice Platform Integration
•	Modified the YOLOv11x codebase to comply with the Matrice BYOM guidelines:
o	Integrated augmentation configurations into the model training pipeline.
o	Enabled the dynamic application of augmentations during training on the Matrice platform.
o	Verified seamless integration by testing the modified code on the platform.

My Experience
Working on this project was both challenging and rewarding. One of the most exciting parts was experimenting with data augmentation techniques to observe their impact on the model's performance. I found it fascinating to see how small adjustments like flipping or scaling could significantly enhance the model's ability to detect objects in diverse scenarios.
The integration with the Matrice platform posed a unique challenge, as it required me to adapt the YOLOv11x model for seamless deployment. Debugging and ensuring compatibility with the BYOM guidelines sharpened my problem-solving skills. I also learned to manage configurations dynamically, a skill that I know will be valuable in future projects.
Throughout this project, I enjoyed the hands-on nature of working with advanced object detection models, transforming raw datasets into actionable insights, and improving model performance through innovative methods. This experience has deepened my understanding of real-world machine learning pipelines and further strengthened my interest in computer vision.
